Hi, Iâ€™m Leandrys, I'm interested in the Cyber-Security world and software development. I'm currently studying at **SkillsforAll academy** and learning about **Networks, Cyber-Threats, Risk Management and Programming Languages**. I have a basic domain of **HTML, CSS, JS, Python** and it will grow soon!. I'd like to collaborate in cybersecurity tools development.
